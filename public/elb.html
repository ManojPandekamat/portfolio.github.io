    <h1 id="title">Amazon Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) Service</h1>

    <section id="intro">
        Amazon Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as Amazon EC2 instances, containers, and IP addresses, in one or more Availability Zones. It helps achieve high availability, fault tolerance, and scalability for your applications.

        <h2>Architecture of ELB</h2>
        <img width="60%" src="../ref-images/elb.png" alt="ELB Architecture" />
        
        <h2>ELB Components</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Load Balancers:</strong> Distribute traffic across registered targets.</li>
            <li><strong>Listeners:</strong> Check for incoming connection requests and route them to targets based on rules.</li>
            <li><strong>Target Groups:</strong> A group of EC2 instances, containers, or IPs registered as traffic destinations.</li>
            <li><strong>Health Checks:</strong> Monitor the health of targets to ensure only healthy ones receive traffic.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Types of Load Balancers</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Application Load Balancer (ALB):</strong> For HTTP/HTTPS traffic; operates at Layer 7 (application layer).</li>
            <li><strong>Network Load Balancer (NLB):</strong> For TCP, TLS, and UDP traffic; operates at Layer 4 (transport layer).</li>
            <li><strong>Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB):</strong> For deploying, scaling, and running third-party virtual appliances.</li>
            <li><strong>Classic Load Balancer (CLB):</strong> Legacy option for EC2 Classic; supports basic Layer 4 and Layer 7 load balancing.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

        <h2>Steps to Set Up ELB in AWS</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Launch EC2 Instances:</strong> Deploy application servers across Availability Zones.</li>
            <li><strong>Create a Load Balancer:</strong> Choose ALB, NLB, or GWLB and configure listeners.</li>
            <li><strong>Define Target Groups:</strong> Register targets like EC2, ECS, or Lambda functions.</li>
            <li><strong>Set Up Health Checks:</strong> Ensure only healthy targets receive traffic.</li>
            <li><strong>Configure Security:</strong> Use security groups, SSL/TLS, and WAF for protection.</li>
            <li><strong>Monitor and Scale:</strong> Use CloudWatch metrics, auto-scaling, and logging for optimization.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Key Features of ELB</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Automatic Scaling:</strong> Handles variable workloads without manual intervention.</li>
            <li><strong>High Availability:</strong> Distributes traffic across multiple AZs.</li>
            <li><strong>Security:</strong> Integrates with AWS Certificate Manager (ACM), WAF, and Shield.</li>
            <li><strong>Flexible Routing:</strong> Supports path-based and host-based routing (ALB).</li>
            <li><strong>Integrated Monitoring:</strong> Provides CloudWatch metrics and access logs.</li>
            <li><strong>Cost-Effective:</strong> Pay only for what you use.</li>
        </ul>

  <h2>Request Routing Algorithms in AWS Load Balancers</h2>
 <br>
  <strong>Round Robin</strong>
  <img src="../code-images/roundRobin.png" alt="elb-rr">
  
  <p> is a simple and widely used algorithm implemented in <em>Application Load Balancers (ALB)</em> and <em>Classic Load Balancers (CLB - TCP)</em>. It routes each incoming request to the next available target in a circular order. This method works best when all targets have similar processing power and response time, as it doesn't account for load or performance differences between instances.</p>
  <br>
  <strong>Least Outstanding Requests (LOR)</strong>
  <img src="../code-images/lor.png" alt="elb-lor">
  <p> is available in <em>CLB (HTTP/HTTPS)</em> and optionally in <em>ALB</em>. It directs traffic to the target that currently has the fewest active or pending requests. This algorithm dynamically balances the load, making it particularly useful in environments where application targets handle requests with varying durations or resource usage, improving responsiveness and throughput.</p>
  <br>
  <strong>Flow Hash (5-tuple Hashing)</strong>
  <img src="../code-images/flowHash.png" alt="elb-flowhash">
  
  <p> is employed by <em>Network Load Balancers (NLB)</em> and <em>Gateway Load Balancers (GWLB)</em>. It uses a consistent hashing mechanism based on five parametersâ€”source IP, source port, destination IP, destination port, and protocol. This ensures that packets from a specific client connection always go to the same backend target, which is essential for maintaining stateful TCP or UDP sessions without requiring sticky session logic.</p>
  <br>
  <strong>Sticky Sessions (Session Affinity)</strong>
  
  <img style="display: block;-webkit-user-select: none;margin: auto;cursor: zoom-in;background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 90%);" src="https://smjeon.dev/assets/img/loadbalancing/sticky-session.gif" width="267" height="200">

  <p> is a mechanism supported by both <em>CLB</em> and <em>ALB</em> to bind a user session to a specific target for the duration of a session. ALB achieves this through application-based cookies, while CLB uses source IP affinity. This is particularly beneficial for applications that store session data locally on an instance, ensuring continuity for end-users even during multiple subsequent requests.</p>

        <h2>AWS Use Cases for ELB</h2>
        <h3>1. Web Application Load Balancing</h3>
        <div
        style="background-color:#f4f6fa; padding: 20px; border-radius: 10px; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">

            <img src="../code-images/web-loadbalancing.png" alt="elb">
            <p>
                To enable scalable and highly available web application hosting on AWS, you need to deploy your application on EC2 instances and create an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) as a template for replication. An Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) is configured to distribute incoming traffic evenly across multiple instances across different availability zones, ensuring fault tolerance and load distribution. An Auto Scaling group is then set up to automatically adjust the number of running instances based on real-time demand and CPU utilization metrics, allowing the system to scale out during high traffic and scale in to save costs when demand decreases. Continuous monitoring of performance metrics such as CPU usage, response time, and instance health is essential to maintain optimal operation and responsiveness. This combination of load balancing and auto scaling ensures the application can efficiently handle varying traffic loads while optimizing resource usage and cost.

        <h3>2. Microservices Architecture</h3>
        <div
                style="background-color:#f4f6fa; padding: 20px; border-radius: 10px; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">

            <p>
This tutorial outlines the process of building and deploying dockerized microservices on Amazon ECS using the Fargate launch type, which eliminates the need to manage underlying EC2 instances. Developers begin by creating an ECS cluster to host their services, followed by building Docker images for each microservice and pushing them to a container registry like ECR or Docker Hub. Each microservice is defined using an ECS task definition that specifies container configurations and resource requirements. ECS services are then created to manage and maintain the desired number of running containers. To achieve load balancing and intelligent routing, an Application Load Balancer (ALB) is integrated, with separate target groups for each microservice. Listeners and routing rules are configured to direct incoming requests to the appropriate services based on path or domain. The ECS tasks are registered with these target groups to receive traffic. The deployment process is managed via the AWS CLI, allowing automation and streamlined configuration of ECS, ECR, and ELB components. By combining ECS, Fargate, and ALB, this approach provides a scalable, manageable, and highly available solution for deploying microservices in production-ready environments.
