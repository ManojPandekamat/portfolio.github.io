    <h1 id="title">Amazon S3: Simple Storage Service</h1>

    <section id="intro">
        Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that provides scalable, secure, and highly available cloud storage for a wide range of data types, such as files, backups, logs, media, and more.
        Amazon S3 is an object storage service that stores data as objects within buckets. An object is a file and any metadata that describes the file. A bucket is a container for objects.
    </section>

    <section>

        <h2>Steps to Set Up S3 in AWS</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Create an S3 Bucket:</strong> Define a unique bucket name and select the AWS region where the bucket will be created.</li>
            <li><strong>Set Bucket Permissions:</strong> Configure permissions to control access to the bucket, using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies, bucket policies, or Access Control Lists (ACLs).</li>
            <li><strong>Upload Objects:</strong> Add files or data (called objects) to the bucket, specifying optional metadata, storage class, and encryption settings.</li>
            <li><strong>Enable Features:</strong> Configure features like versioning, lifecycle policies, cross-region replication, and event notifications to manage the data efficiently.</li>
            <li><strong>Access and Manage:</strong> Access objects via the S3 console, AWS CLI, SDKs, or APIs, using secure URLs or presigned URLs for controlled sharing.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How AWS Manages Storage</h2>
        <p>
            AWS S3 leverages a globally distributed infrastructure with redundancy across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) to ensure high durability and availability.
        </p>
        <h2>Key Features:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Durability:</strong> Designed for 99.999999999% (11 nines) durability by storing multiple copies of data across facilities.</li>
            <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Scales automatically to handle unlimited data and concurrent access requests.</li>
            <li><strong>Security:</strong> Provides encryption at rest and in transit, fine-grained access control, and audit logging with AWS CloudTrail.</li>
            <li><strong>Cost-Effectiveness:</strong> Offers multiple storage classes to optimize cost based on access patterns, such as S3 Standard, S3 Glacier, and S3 Intelligent-Tiering.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            S3’s architecture ensures that data remains available, durable, and secure, making it ideal for backup, archival, data lakes, and modern application data.

        <h2>Amazon S3 Buckets and Objects</h2>
        <img src="../ref-images/s3.png" alt="s3">
        
    <h3>Bucket</h3>
    <p>
        A <strong>bucket</strong> in Amazon S3 is a top-level container that holds your data. Think of it as a logical container for storing objects, similar to a folder or a drive. Each bucket has a globally unique name and is tied to a specific AWS region.
    </p>

    <h3>Object</h3>
    <p>
        An <strong>object</strong> in Amazon S3 is the fundamental storage unit. It consists of two main parts:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Data:</strong> The actual content you want to store, such as a file, image, video, or document.</li>
            <li><strong>Metadata:</strong> Key-value pairs that describe the object, such as its content type, creation date, custom tags, and permissions.</li>
        </ul>
        Each object is uniquely identified within a bucket by a combination of the bucket name and the object key (the unique name you assign to the object).
    </p>

    <h2>How S3 Stores and Retrieves Data</h2>
    <img src="../ref-images/s3-flow.png" alt="s3-flow">
    <p>
        This diagram shows how Amazon S3 handles data storage and retrieval behind the scenes. When a user interacts with S3 (such as uploading or retrieving an object), the request first goes through the <strong>API Service</strong>, which coordinates the workflow. The API Service passes the data to two key backend components: the <strong>Data Service</strong>, which handles the actual object data, encrypting it (for example, using SSE-S3) and distributing it across multiple <strong>storage nodes</strong> (like Storage Node #1 and #2) for durability and availability; and the <strong>Metadata Service</strong>, which manages all the object’s metadata (such as object name, ID, bucket ID) and writes it into the <strong>Metadata Database</strong>. This separation ensures that S3 can quickly look up objects by their metadata and locate the exact storage location. The combination of data encryption, distributed storage, and a centralized metadata index enables S3 to deliver secure, fast, and scalable object storage — making sure objects are easily retrievable using just the bucket name and object key.

    <h2>S3 Bucket Lookup Using Consistent Hashing</h2>
    <div     style="background-color:#f4f6fa; padding: 20px; border-radius: 10px; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;" 
    >
        <p>
            Amazon S3 uses <strong>consistent hashing</strong> to distribute bucket names evenly across storage nodes. This technique helps achieve efficient, scalable, and fault-tolerant bucket lookups by mapping buckets and nodes on a hash ring. It minimizes remapping when nodes are added or removed, ensuring fast access to buckets.
        </p>
    <h2>Consistent Hashing Implementation (Python)</h2>

<pre>
    <code>
import hashlib
import bisect

class ConsistentHashRing:
    def __init__(self, servers=None, replicas=3):
        self.replicas = replicas  # virtual nodes for better distribution
        self.ring = dict()
        self.sorted_keys = []
        
        if servers:
            for server in servers:
                self.add_server(server)
    
    def _hash(self, key):
        # Use md5, convert to int
        return int(hashlib.md5(key.encode('utf-8')).hexdigest(), 16)
    
    def add_server(self, server):
        for i in range(self.replicas):
            virtual_node_key = f"{server}#{i}"
            hash_key = self._hash(virtual_node_key)
            self.ring[hash_key] = server
            bisect.insort(self.sorted_keys, hash_key)
    
    def remove_server(self, server):
        for i in range(self.replicas):
            virtual_node_key = f"{server}#{i}"
            hash_key = self._hash(virtual_node_key)
            del self.ring[hash_key]
            index = bisect.bisect_left(self.sorted_keys, hash_key)
            self.sorted_keys.pop(index)
    
    def get_server(self, key):
        if not self.ring:
            return None
        hash_key = self._hash(key)
        # Find the first server hash >= key hash
        index = bisect.bisect(self.sorted_keys, hash_key)
        if index == len(self.sorted_keys):
            index = 0  # wrap around
        return self.ring[self.sorted_keys[index]]


# Example usage:
servers = ["server1", "server2", "server3"]
ring = ConsistentHashRing(servers)

buckets = ["bucket-alpha", "bucket-beta", "bucket-gamma", "bucket-delta"]

for bucket in buckets:
    server = ring.get_server(bucket)
    print(f"{bucket} is stored on {server}")

# Try removing a server
ring.remove_server("server2")
print("\nAfter removing server2:")

for bucket in buckets:
    server = ring.get_server(bucket)
    print(f"{bucket} is stored on {server}")

    </code>
</pre>

    <h2>Steps to Map Buckets to Nodes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Hash each node identifier multiple times to create virtual nodes, spreading them around the ring.</li>
        <li>Hash each bucket name to find its position on the ring.</li>
        <li>Assign the bucket to the first virtual node found clockwise on the ring.</li>
        <li>If a node is removed, buckets mapped to it are reassigned to the next virtual node clockwise.</li>
    </ul>

    
    <h2>Visual Representation</h2>
    <pre>
        Hash Ring (circle)
        
    vnode N1#0  ●--------------------● vnode N3#1
               ↑                     ↑
               |                     |
         bucket-A               bucket-B
               ↓                     ↓
    vnode N2#2  ●                 ● vnode N1#2

    Arrows show bucket hash positions pointing clockwise to assigned nodes.
    </pre>

    
    <h4>
         <h2>Time and Space Complexity of Consistent Hashing</h2>
         <p>
        <strong>Time Complexity:</strong><br />
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Lookup time:</strong> O(log N) — The ring structure uses a sorted data structure allowing fast binary search to find the node responsible for a given bucket.</li>
            <li><strong>Adding or removing nodes:</strong> O(K log N) — Each physical node is represented by K virtual nodes. Updating the ring involves inserting or deleting these virtual nodes efficiently.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Space Complexity:</strong><br />
        <ul>
            <li>O(N × K) — The ring stores K virtual nodes for each of the N physical nodes to ensure even distribution.</li>
            <li>Additional space is required for storing metadata of the M buckets managed by the system.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Where:<br />
        <strong>N</strong> = Number of physical nodes (servers)<br />
        <strong>K</strong> = Number of virtual nodes per physical node<br />
        <strong>M</strong> = Number of buckets or objects stored
