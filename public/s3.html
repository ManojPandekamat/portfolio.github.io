    <h1 id="title">Amazon S3: Simple Storage Service</h1>

    <section id="intro">
        Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that provides scalable, secure, and highly available cloud storage for a wide range of data types, such as files, backups, logs, media, and more.
        Amazon S3 is an object storage service that stores data as objects within buckets. An object is a file and any metadata that describes the file. A bucket is a container for objects.

        <h2>Steps to Set Up S3 in AWS</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Create an S3 Bucket:</strong> Define a unique bucket name and select the AWS region where the bucket will be created.</li>
            <li><strong>Set Bucket Permissions:</strong> Configure permissions to control access to the bucket, using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies, bucket policies, or Access Control Lists (ACLs).</li>
            <li><strong>Upload Objects:</strong> Add files or data (called objects) to the bucket, specifying optional metadata, storage class, and encryption settings.</li>
            <li><strong>Enable Features:</strong> Configure features like versioning, lifecycle policies, cross-region replication, and event notifications to manage the data efficiently.</li>
            <li><strong>Access and Manage:</strong> Access objects via the S3 console, AWS CLI, SDKs, or APIs, using secure URLs or presigned URLs for controlled sharing.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How AWS Manages Storage</h2>
        <p>
            AWS S3 leverages a globally distributed infrastructure with redundancy across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) to ensure high durability and availability.
        </p>
        <h2>Key Features:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Durability:</strong> Designed for 99.999999999% (11 nines) durability by storing multiple copies of data across facilities.</li>
            <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Scales automatically to handle unlimited data and concurrent access requests.</li>
            <li><strong>Security:</strong> Provides encryption at rest and in transit, fine-grained access control, and audit logging with AWS CloudTrail.</li>
            <li><strong>Cost-Effectiveness:</strong> Offers multiple storage classes to optimize cost based on access patterns, such as S3 Standard, S3 Glacier, and S3 Intelligent-Tiering.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            S3’s architecture ensures that data remains available, durable, and secure, making it ideal for backup, archival, data lakes, and modern application data.

        <h2>Amazon S3 Buckets and Objects</h2>
        <img src="../ref-images/s3.png" alt="s3">
        
    <h3>Bucket</h3>
    <p>
        A <strong>bucket</strong> in Amazon S3 is a top-level container that holds your data. Think of it as a logical container for storing objects, similar to a folder or a drive. Each bucket has a globally unique name and is tied to a specific AWS region.
    </p>

    <h3>Object</h3>
    <p>
        An <strong>object</strong> in Amazon S3 is the fundamental storage unit. It consists of two main parts:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Data:</strong> The actual content you want to store, such as a file, image, video, or document.</li>
            <li><strong>Metadata:</strong> Key-value pairs that describe the object, such as its content type, creation date, custom tags, and permissions.</li>
        </ul>
        Each object is uniquely identified within a bucket by a combination of the bucket name and the object key (the unique name you assign to the object).
    </p>

    <h2>How S3 Stores and Retrieves Data</h2>
    <img src="../ref-images/s3-flow.png" alt="s3-flow">
    <p>
        This diagram shows how Amazon S3 handles data storage and retrieval behind the scenes. When a user interacts with S3 (such as uploading or retrieving an object), the request first goes through the <strong>API Service</strong>, which coordinates the workflow. The API Service passes the data to two key backend components: the <strong>Data Service</strong>, which handles the actual object data, encrypting it (for example, using SSE-S3) and distributing it across multiple <strong>storage nodes</strong> (like Storage Node #1 and #2) for durability and availability; and the <strong>Metadata Service</strong>, which manages all the object’s metadata (such as object name, ID, bucket ID) and writes it into the <strong>Metadata Database</strong>. This separation ensures that S3 can quickly look up objects by their metadata and locate the exact storage location. The combination of data encryption, distributed storage, and a centralized metadata index enables S3 to deliver secure, fast, and scalable object storage — making sure objects are easily retrievable using just the bucket name and object key.
