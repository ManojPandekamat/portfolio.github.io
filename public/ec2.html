    <h1 id="title">Amazon EC2: Elastic Cloud Computing</h1>

    <section id="intro">
        Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a scalable, on-demand cloud computing service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that enables users to launch and manage virtual servers, known as instances, to run applications and workloads in the cloud.

        <h2>Steps to Create an EC2 Instance in AWS</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Select AWS Region:</strong> The user begins by choosing the AWS region where the instance will be launched. This determines the physical data center location.</li>
            <li><strong>Choose a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC):</strong> The user selects a VPC that isolates the instance in a private network environment.</li>
            <li><strong>Launch the EC2 Instance:</strong> The user selects the instance type and Amazon Machine Image (AMI), then launches the instance inside the chosen VPC.</li>
            <li><strong>Associate with Security Group:</strong> Attach a security group to the instance. The security group acts as a virtual firewall controlling inbound and outbound traffic, e.g., allowing SSH (port 22) or HTTP (port 80).</li>
            <li><strong>Connect Instance to Internet:</strong> Ensure the instance has a public IP address or Elastic IP, and that the subnet is associated with an Internet Gateway. This allows the instance to communicate with the internet.</li>
        </ul>

    <p>
        Want to see how EC2 instance allocation can be optimized using intelligent algorithms?
        Explore how we apply the <strong>Stable Marriage Problem</strong> to allocate VMs to hosts efficiently,
        ensuring better load balancing and resource utilization.

        <h2>How AWS manages VM</h2>
        <p>
            AWS uses <strong>AWS Nitro System</strong>, a collection of hardware and software components designed to provide high performance, security, and efficiency for Amazon EC2 instances.
        </p>
        <h2>Key Features:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Dedicated Hardware:</strong> Offloads many traditional virtualization functions to custom hardware, reducing overhead.</li>
            <li><strong>Security:</strong> Isolates compute, memory, and storage resources to enhance security and protect customer data.</li>
            <li><strong>Performance:</strong> Minimizes virtualization overhead, enabling near bare-metal performance for EC2 instances.</li>
            <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Supports a wide range of instance types and sizes, helping AWS deliver flexible cloud computing resources.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Nitro is the foundation for modern EC2 instances and enables AWS to innovate faster by improving security and performance without compromising scalability.
