    <h1 id="title">Amazon RDS: Relational Database Service</h1>

    <section id="intro">
        Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a managed relational database service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It simplifies the setup, operation, and scaling of databases in the cloud, offering cost-efficient and resizable capacity while automating tasks such as backups, patching, and monitoring.
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Architecture of RDS</h2>
        <img  width="60%" src="../ref-images/rds.png" alt="rds">
        <ul>
    <li>
        <strong>AWS RDS</strong> (Relational Database Service) is a managed service that provides databases running on dedicated <strong>EC2 (Elastic Cloud Compute)</strong> servers. Users can start and use the service without worrying about the underlying components.
    </li>
    <li>
        On top of <strong>EC2</strong>, the <strong>DB software</strong> (like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or Oracle) runs, but we do not have direct access to either the EC2 layer or the DB software layer — we only specify configurations such as CPU, memory, storage, and database engine.
    </li>
    <li>
        The <strong>Endpoint</strong> is the fully qualified hostname or address that applications use to connect to the RDS database, along with the port number.
    </li>
    <li>
        All RDS resources are hosted inside a <strong>VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)</strong>, which is a logically isolated section of the AWS cloud. A VPC maps to a region and contains <strong>subnets</strong>, which are logical subdivisions, each tied to an <strong>Availability Zone (AZ)</strong> — similar to physical data centers. This ensures resources are grouped securely and no other AWS account can access them.
    </li>
    <li>
        A <strong>Security Group</strong> acts as a virtual firewall, safeguarding the RDS instance. It controls inbound and outbound traffic, ensuring only authorized clients can connect to the database through the specified endpoint.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Read Replicas</strong> help scale out read-heavy workloads by asynchronously copying updates from the primary database. This is useful when, for example, a web application handles both user-facing and reporting tasks — the read replicas handle all the read-only traffic, while the primary handles both reads and writes.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Backup and Maintenance</strong> are automatically handled by AWS. RDS takes storage volume snapshots of the entire DB instance for backups, ensuring data durability. To minimize performance impacts, it’s recommended to schedule backups and maintenance tasks during off-peak application usage times.
    </li>
</ul>

    <h2>Smart Querying & Indexing in AWS RDS</h2>

        <h3>Business Goal: Revenue between two dates, fast range sums.</h3>
        
     <h2>Sample Schema for Revenue Table</h2>
    <img src="../code-images/RDS-fenwickTree.png" alt="Schema for orders table with order_id, user_id, order_date, amount">

        <h2>Sample Schema for Storing Results in DB</h2>
    <img src="../code-images/RDS_fenwickTree2.png" alt="Schema for daily revenue prefix sums table with revenue_date and prefix_sum columns">
    
    <p>
        <strong>Approach Explanation:</strong><br>
        To efficiently retrieve total revenue within any date range, we preprocess the orders data by building a Fenwick Tree (also called a Binary Indexed Tree) over daily revenues. This data structure allows fast prefix sum queries in O(log n) time. We store these prefix sums in a dedicated table in the database, allowing quick range-sum calculations by subtracting prefix sums at appropriate dates. This avoids scanning large amounts of order data during queries and significantly speeds up reporting and analytics tasks.
    </p>
    <h2>Sample Python Code for this Approach</h2>


    <pre>
        <code>
import mysql.connector
from datetime import datetime
class FenwickTree:
    def __init__(self, size):
        self.tree = [0] * (size + 1)

    def update(self, index, value):
        while index < len(self.tree):
            self.tree[index] += value
            index += index & -index

    def query(self, index):
        res = 0
        while index > 0:
            res += self.tree[index]
            index -= index & -index
        return res

conn = mysql.connector.connect(
    host="your-host",
    user="your-username",
    password="your-password",
    database="your-database"
)
cursor = conn.cursor()

cursor.execute("SELECT order_date, amount FROM orders ORDER BY order_date")
rows = cursor.fetchall()

# Create date to index mapping
date_list = sorted(list({row[0] for row in rows}))
date_to_index = {date: i+1 for i, date in enumerate(date_list)}  # 1-based index

ft = FenwickTree(len(date_list))
for date, amount in rows:
    idx = date_to_index[date]
    ft.update(idx, float(amount))

cursor.execute("DROP TABLE IF EXISTS daily_revenue_prefix")
cursor.execute("""
CREATE TABLE daily_revenue_prefix (
    revenue_date DATE PRIMARY KEY,
    prefix_sum DECIMAL(10,2)
)
""")

for date, idx in date_to_index.items():
    psum = ft.query(idx)
    cursor.execute("INSERT INTO daily_revenue_prefix (revenue_date, prefix_sum) VALUES (%s, %s)", (date, psum))

conn.commit()

def get_revenue(start_date: str, end_date: str):
    # Get prefix sum for end and (start - 1)
    cursor.execute("SELECT prefix_sum FROM daily_revenue_prefix WHERE revenue_date <= %s ORDER BY revenue_date DESC LIMIT 1", (end_date,))
    end_val = cursor.fetchone()
    cursor.execute("SELECT prefix_sum FROM daily_revenue_prefix WHERE revenue_date < %s ORDER BY revenue_date DESC LIMIT 1", (start_date,))
    start_val = cursor.fetchone()
    return round((end_val[0] if end_val else 0) - (start_val[0] if start_val else 0), 2)

print("Revenue from 2024-01-01 to 2024-03-01:", get_revenue("2024-01-01", "2024-03-01"))

cursor.close()
conn.close()

        </code>
    </pre>

        <p>
        <strong>Code Explanation:</strong><br>
        The code connects to the SQL database and fetches all orders sorted by date. It maps unique dates to indices and builds a Fenwick Tree where each node stores cumulative revenue sums. After building the tree, it calculates prefix sums for all dates and inserts them into a new database table for fast retrieval. The query function uses these stored prefix sums to quickly compute total revenue between any two dates with just two lookups and simple subtraction, enabling efficient range queries.
    </p>

<h2>Time and Space Complexity</h2>
<h4>

    <p>
        <strong>Time Complexity:</strong><br />
        - Building the Fenwick Tree takes <code>O(n log n)</code> time, where <code>n</code> is the number of unique dates.<br />
        - Each update and prefix sum query operation runs in <code>O(log n)</code> time.<br />
        - Range sum queries (between two dates) use two prefix queries, so overall <code>O(log n)</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Space Complexity:</strong><br />
        - The Fenwick Tree requires <code>O(n)</code> space to store prefix sums.<br />
        - Additional space is used for mapping dates to indices, also <code>O(n)</code>.<br />
        - The <code>daily_revenue_prefix</code> table stores <code>n</code> rows in the database.
    </p>
    <p>
        This approach significantly improves performance for repeated range revenue queries by avoiding
        scanning all rows every time and instead leveraging prefix sums.
    </p>
